# How to install phpMyAdmin on Debian 10
### What you need
- Root acces to the server
- Debian 10 (Best installed freshly)
### What you DON'T need
- Much time (10 Minutes should be enough)
- A subscription to get you deducted
- Lots of Linux experience (If you only know a bit what you're doing, it's okay. The instructions are regulating the rest.)
## The installation
### Step 1
```
cd
```

### Step 2
```
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 3
```
apt install wget -y
```
### Step 4
```

```

### Step 5

Now you should answer the follwing questions like this: <br>
1. Set root password?
* ``Y`` if you want to change it. (New password required)
* ``n`` if you want to use your root-Password. (You can change it later)
2. Remove anonymous users?
* Press ``Y`` to remove them.
3. Disallow root login remotely?
* If you don't want to control the database from the webpanel (y.ou.r.ip/phpMyAdmin), you can answer with ``Y``.
* If you want to manage the database through the webpanel, you should type in ``n``.
4. Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]
**Type in ``Y`` to reload the privilege tables.
